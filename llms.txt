# MathOnTape

> Signal flow as compositional architecture. Experimental electronic music.

## About

Most electronic music is composed by intuition. MathOnTape applies signal flow — the engineering discipline of intentional routing — as compositional method. Each component does one job, connects intentionally, ripples predictably.

Dirty analog synths, magnetic tape, feedback loops deliberately routed. The visual identity mirrors the sonic texture: MICR typography (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition — bank check typeface), archival naming conventions, halftone patterns as tape hiss, misregistration as distortion.

You can't pull the design away without breaking the whole thing. Integration is the proof.
