# Ambient Study 01

## Concept
A generative ambient piece built from field recordings of industrial spaces. The system uses probabilistic algorithms to select, process, and arrange sound fragments in real-time.

## Technical Approach
- **Source Material:** 20+ hours of field recordings (factories, train stations, construction sites)
- **Processing:** Granular synthesis, time-stretching, spectral filtering
- **Generation:** Max/MSP patch with Markov chain-based sequencer
- **Output:** Rendered as fixed composition (this version), also available as live generative system

## Notes
This is study #1 in a series exploring the boundary between documentary (field recording) and composition (musical arrangement). The goal is to preserve the spatial character of the source environment while creating harmonic and rhythmic structures.
